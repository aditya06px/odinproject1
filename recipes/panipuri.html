    <h3>Desription :</h3>
    <p>Panipuri consists of a round or ball-shaped, hollow puri (a deep-fried crisp flatbread), filled with a mixture of flavored water (known as imli pani), tamarind chutney, chili powder, chaat masala, potato mash, onion or chickpeas</p>

    <h3>Ingredients :</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> chaat masala</li>
        <li>Fuchka </li>
        <li> chili powde</li>
        <li>potato mash</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps :</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Assemble everything before you begin to make pani puri.</li>
        <li>Adding ice cubes may dilute the taste and flavor of the pani.</li>
        <li>Addition of black salt gives a really good taste and flavor. So if possible do try to add black salt in the pani recipe.</li>
        <li>Rinse 1 cup tightly packed coriander leaves, ½ cup tightly packed mint leaves, 2 to 3 green chilies and 1 inch ginger very well. Peel the ginger and roughly chop it.</li>
        <li>Add coriander leaves, mint leaves, ginger and green chili in a grinder or blender jar. For a less spicy pani you can add just 1 chopped green chilli.</li>
        <li>Now add 1 teaspoon roasted cumin powder, 1 teaspoon chaat masala and salt as per taste.</li>
        <li> Add ⅓ cup water and grind to a smooth consistency.</li>
        <li>Remove the chutney in a bowl or a small pan.</li>
        <li>Now add ½ cup water in the grinder jar and swirl the jar so that the chutney at the sides of the jar gets mixed with the water.</li>
        <li> Then add ½ to ¾ cup water. You can add less or more water depending on the consistency you want.</li>
        <li>Mix very well. Cover the pan and refrigerate the pani. Before refrigerating you can also add 1 to 1.5 tablespoon boondi.</li>
        <li> Boil 2 to 3 medium potatoes. When warm, peel them and chop them in small cubes.</li>
        <li>Add 1 to 1.5 tablespoon chopped coriander leaves.</li>    
        <li>Then add ¼ teaspoon red chili powder, 1 teaspoon chaat masala and 1 teaspoon roasted cumin powder. Also add salt as per taste.</li>
        <li>Mix very well. Keep aside.</li>
        <li>Keep everything ready before you start assembling the pani puri.</li>
    </ol>
